/* PURCHASE ORDER
(See the comment on the PR class first)
Once the purchaser gets the PR and finds a suitable quote from a supplier, the purchaser then generates
a PO, which acts as a contract between the buyer and the seller regarding what items are to be delivered,
by when, and how much the buyer will pay for them.

Typically, a supplier never begins production without a PO from the buyer unless they're trusted, as they
would have no legally binding agreement regarding the deal.
