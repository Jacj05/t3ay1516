    // Tips:
        // 1. Use int variables and loop of your choice (for, while, do-while)
        // 2. Equation form: Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2
        // 3. You may need a variable to (a) hold current sum or (b) change values of the x's

    // Exercise 2.2
    // Implement a primality test of numbers from 2 to maxNumber
    int maxNumber = 1000;
    // A number x is prime iff x >= 2, and its only factors are 1 and itself
    // Tips:
        // 1. To check if a number d divides x: (x % d == 0)
            // x mod d == 0
            // Having 0 as modulo means d divides x fully
            // Example: 100 % 50 = 0 (since 100/50 = 2 r 0), so 50 divides 100 fully
            // Example: 97 % 12 = 1, so 12 does not divide 97 fully since there is remainder 1
        // 2. For a given number 2 <= x <= maxNumber, you don't need to test from 2 to maxNumber
            // d should be less than x (d < x)
            // Example: given 97, there is no need to check if 75 can divide it fully
            // Determine the max value of d that minimizes the number of division tests
        // 3. Optional: all even numbers except 2 are automatically not prime
            // 2 is the only even prime number
